# Feasibility Study – EMS

## 1. Executive Summary
EMS is a web-based system to manage employees, attendance, shifts, payroll and reporting. The proposed tech stack (React + Express + MongoDB) is well-suited for rapid development and maintainability with modest operational cost.

## 2. Technical Feasibility
- Frontend: React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind/shadcn provides a fast, modern DX and responsive UI.
- Backend: Express + TypeScript is simple and flexible. Mongoose models map well to document data.
- Reporting: ExcelJS provides server-side xlsx export across all report endpoints.
- Hosting: Can be deployed on a single VM or containerized (Docker). Horizontal scaling achievable (stateless API, shared DB).
- Risks: Heavy reports or large attendance ranges may impact performance; can offload to background jobs or add database indexes.

## 3. Economic Feasibility
- Open-source libraries keep licensing costs near zero.
- Operational costs scale with data and traffic; Mongo Atlas or self-hosted Mongo acceptable.
- Developer productivity high due to TypeScript and clear separation of concerns.

## 4. Operational Feasibility
- Admins and HR staff can use the web UI with minimal training.
- Reports export directly to Excel for existing workflows.
- Authentication with JWT is widely understood; can integrate with SSO later.

## 5. Schedule Feasibility
- MVP can be delivered quickly with the chosen stack.
- Additional modules (advanced analytics, RBAC, SSO) can be phased in.

## 6. Legal & Compliance
- Store minimal PII (names, emails, optional phone). Follow data privacy standards.
- Add audit logging and consent screens as needed for production.

## 7. Alternatives Considered
- SQL + ORM: Strong consistency and relational modeling; higher upfront schema effort.
- Serverless: Simplifies ops; pricing model and cold starts must be evaluated.
- Off-the-shelf HRM: Faster start but less flexibility and recurring licensing costs.

## 8. Risk Assessment & Mitigation
- Performance of large aggregations → use indexes, pre-aggregation, background jobs.
- Data integrity across modules → enforce unique indexes and validation.
- Security (token theft, CORS) → HTTPs, secure storage, rotating secrets.

## 9. Conclusion
The proposed EMS is feasible with the selected technology. It balances speed of development, cost, and maintainability while leaving room for future growth.
